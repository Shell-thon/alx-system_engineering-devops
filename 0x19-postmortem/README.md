# Postmortem: Shell-Thon Application Outage

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: May 15, 2023, 8:00 AM - May 17, 2023, 12:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: Service outage for the Shell-Thon Application, affecting 90% of users. Users encountered error messages and were unable to access any functionality of the application.

## Timeline
- May 15, 2023, 8:00 AM: The issue was detected when multiple users reported encountering errors and the monitoring system detected a sharp increase in error rates.
- Actions taken: The development team investigated the backend codebase and server logs to identify the root cause. Initial assumption: Bug in the PHP code causing a critical system failure.
- Misleading investigation/debugging paths: Extensive code reviews were performed, but no specific bug was found that could explain the complete system failure.
- The incident was escalated to the senior development team and the security team.

## Resolution
- Root cause: The investigation revealed that the server hosting the Shell-Thon Application had multiple PHP vulnerabilities that were exploited, leading to a complete system crash.
- Resolution: The server's PHP version was updated to the latest secure release, and all known vulnerabilities were patched. Additionally, a security audit was conducted to identify and fix any other potential vulnerabilities.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Code review and testing: Implement a comprehensive code review process for the Shell-Thon Application to catch potential bugs and vulnerabilities before deployment. Enhance testing practices, including security testing, to ensure robustness.
- Regular vulnerability assessments: Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing for the Shell-Thon Application to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- Server hardening: Strengthen server configurations for the Shell-Thon Application, apply security patches promptly, and follow best practices to mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities.
- Training and awareness: Provide ongoing training to developers and the security team working on the Shell-Thon Application to stay updated on the latest security practices and emerging threats in PHP and web application development.

## Tasks
1. Implement a rigorous code review process with a focus on bug detection and vulnerability scanning for the Shell-Thon Application.
2. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing specifically for the Shell-Thon Application to identify and address security weaknesses.
3. Establish a server hardening plan for the infrastructure hosting the Shell-Thon Application, including timely patching and adherence to security best practices.
4. Organize training sessions and knowledge sharing initiatives for the development and security teams working on the Shell-Thon Application to enhance their awareness of PHP security and web application vulnerabilities.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the overall security posture of the Shell-Thon Application, minimize the risk of future outages due to bugs and vulnerabilities, and ensure a seamless user experience.
